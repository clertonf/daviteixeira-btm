### 🦇 **_Davi Teixeira_** 🦇

My name is Davi Teixeira, from Brazil (🇧🇷). I am an undergraduate student in Information Systems at the Federal University of Ceará - Campus de Quixadá and I am looking for experiences that will lead me to a professional training as a fullstack developer!

I am a reliable and hardworking professional, paid attention to details, I have excellent interpersonal and time management skills, I always seek professional improvement and experiences in IT and its technologies.

In my free time I like to play (🎮), watch movies and series (📺), read books (📚), listen to music (🎵) and drink a nice cup of coffee (☕️) while I exercise my detective profession in my spare time ( 🕵️‍♂️)
